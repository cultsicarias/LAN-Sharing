Flash Transfer v2
Flash Transfer is a simple, private, and high-speed file sharing application that runs entirely on your local network. It allows you to transfer files between any devices (PC, Mac, Android, iOS) that are connected to the same WiFi, using only a web browser.

The core principle is that one computer runs a lightweight server, and any other device can connect to it through a simple web page, enabling two-way file transfers at the maximum speed your network can handle.

‚ú® Key Features
Blazing Fast Speeds: Transfers files at the speed of your local network (up to 1 Gbps or more), bypassing slow internet uploads.

Real-time Speed Monitoring: See the actual transfer rate in Megabits per second (Mbps) as you upload.

Cross-Platform: Works on any device with a modern web browser. No need to install separate apps on your phone or other computers.

Dual Upload Modes:

Permanent: Save files for long-term access.

Broadcast: Share files temporarily with anyone on the network.

100% Private: Your files never leave your home or office network. No cloud servers are involved, ensuring complete privacy and security.

Easy Mobile Access: A QR code is generated in the terminal on startup, allowing you to connect from your phone instantly.

Simple Setup: Requires only Node.js on the host machine.

üéØ Use Cases & Advantages
